# Implementing a String collection class for a dictionary of words 
I was tasked with creating my own data structure that was a collection of strings that defined 3 core methods:

  - public void add(String word):
    Adds a String to the collection
  - public int count(String word):
    Returns the number of times a String is in the collection
  - public void remove(String word):
    Removes one occurrence of a String from the collection, or leaves the collection unchanged if the String does not occur in it. 

There were then 5 tests given to us to run to test the efficiency of the data structure in multiple ways.

The write-up provided explains everything done in detail.
